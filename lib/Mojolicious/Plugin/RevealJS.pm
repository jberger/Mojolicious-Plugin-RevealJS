=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::RevealJS - Mojolicious ❤️ Reveal.js

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  plugin 'RevealJS';

  any '/' => { template => 'mytalk', layout => 'revealjs' };

  app->start;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::RevealJS> is yet another attempt at making presentations with L<Mojolicious>.
While the author's previous attempts have tried do too much, this one simply makes it easier to use L<Reveal.js|http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js>.
It provides a layout (C<revealjs>) which contains the boilerplate and loads the bundled libraries.
It also provides a few simple helpers.
Future versions of the plugin will allow setting of configuration like themes.

The bundled version of Reveal.js is currently 3.7.0.
The bundled version of reveal-sampler is currently cd4a07d.

Note that this module is in an alpha form!
The author makes no compatibilty promises.

=head1 LAYOUTS

  # controller
  $c->layout('revealjs'); # or
  $c->stash(layout => 'revealjs');

  # or template
  % layout 'revealjs';

=head2 revealjs

This layout is essentially the standard template distributed as part of the Reveal.js tarball.
It is modified for use in a Mojolicious template.

=head3 stash paramters

It accepts the stash parameters:

=over

=item *

author - sets the metadata value

=item *

description - sets the metadata value

=item *

init - Reveal.js initialization options, a hashref for JSON conversion documented below

=item *

theme - a string representing a theme css to be included.
If the string ends in C<.css> it is included literally, otherwise it is assumed to be the name of a bundled Reveal.js theme.
Bundled themes are: black, white, league, beige, sky, night, serif, simple, solarized.
Defaults to black.
See more on the L<"Reveal.js page"|https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#theming>.

=item *

title - sets the window title, not used on the title slide

=item *

base - sets the C<< <base> >> tag for the document.
Useful for hosting static pages at a location other than C</>.
Defaults to C</>, if explicitly set to C<undef> the tag is not included.

=item *

hljs_theme_url - sets the url path for loading a css theme for highlight js.
Defaults to a bundled zenburn theme.

=back

=head3 initialization parameters

As mentioned above, the stash key C<init> is a hashref that is merge into a set of defaults and used to initialize Reveal.js.
Some RevealJS initialization options, specifically those that have a default are:

=over

=item *

center - enable slide centering (boolean, true by default)

=item *

controls - enable controls (boolean, true by default)

=item *

history - enable history (boolean, true by default)

=item *

progress - enable progress indicator (boolean, true by default)

=item *

transition - set the slide transition type (one of: none, fade, slide, convex, concave, zoom; default: slide)

=back

These defaults are set in the default stash value for C<revealjs.init>.
So they can be modified globally modifying that value (probably during setup).

  $app->defaults->{'revealjs.init'}{transition} = 'none';

Note that booleans are references to scalar values, C<true == \1>, C<false == \0>.
See more availalbe options on the L<"Reveal.js page"|https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration>.

=head3 additional templates

In order to further customize the template the following unimplemented templates are included into the layout

=over

=item *

C<revealjs_head.html.ep> - included at the end of the C<< <head> >> tag.

=item *

C<revealjs_preinit.js.ep> - included just before initializing Reveal.js.
Especially useful to modify the javascript variable C<init>.

=item *

C<revealjs_body.html.ep> - included at the end of the C<< <body> >> tag.

=back

=head1 HELPERS

=head2 include_code

  %= include_code 'path/to/file.pl'

NOTE this helper is mildly-deprecated in favor of the reveal-sampler plugin and L</include_sample>.
It isn't going away yet, but if things work out with that functionality this method may eventually be implemented via it or removed entirely.

This helper does several things:

=over

=item *

localizes trailing arguments into the stash

=item *

slurps a file containing code

=item *

http escapes the content

=item *

applies some simple formatting

=item *

displays the relative path to the location of the file (for the benefit of repo cloners)

=back

The helper takes a file name and additional key-value pairs.
The following keys and their value are removed from the pairs, the remaining are localized into the stash:

=over

=item language

sets the language for the highlighting, defaults to the value of C<< stash('language') // 'perl' >>

=item section

limits the section to a given section name

=item include_filename

if true (default) include the filename when the code is included

=back

NOTE: This feature is experimental!

The section is definite by a line comment of the form C<#> or C<//> or C<--> or C<< <!-- >> followed by C<reveal begin $name> and ended with comment mark followed by C<reveal end $name>.

  %= include_code 'path/to/file', section => 'part1'

Then in the file

  Excluded content

  # reveal begin part1
  Included content
  # reveal end part1

  Excluded content

=head2 include_sample

  %= include_sample 'path/to/file.pl'

The spiritual successor (and possbily actually the sucessor) to L</include_code>.
The heavy lifting is done in the client via the reveal-sampler plugin which is bundled.
It is much simpler than L</include_code>.

It takes the url of the file to render, which must be in a publicly available via static render.
This file path may also contain a url fragment designating the section or line numbers to display.
Read more at L<https://github.com/ldionne/reveal-sampler>.

After the file url, the following trailing key-value pair options are available.

=over

=item language

Sets the language for the highlighting.
Note that the alias C<lang> is also allowed and defaults to the value of the C<language> stash value.
If this is not set, the client-side code will also attempt to set it based on the file extension.

=item mark

Sets lines to be marked by the client.
This follows the documentation at L<https://github.com/ldionne/reveal-sampler>.

=item indent

Instructs reveal-sampler to "keep" or "remove" any overall indentation in the sample.
This follows the documentation at L<https://github.com/ldionne/reveal-sampler>.

Note that the default behavior (for when "indent" is not set) can be set in L</init>.
The default (from the plugin itself), is false.

  $c->stash( init => { sampler => { removeIndentation => \1 } } );

=item trim

Sets the C<data-trim> attribute for revealjs.

=item noescape

Sets the C<data-noescape> attribute for revealjs.
Note that if the L</mark> option is used, the front-end will automatically apply this attribute.

=item annotation

A text line to be rendered below the code section.
This is normally used to display the file name/path.
If not explicitly given it will default to the url of the file (without any fragment).
If explicitly undefined, the annotation will not be rendered.

=back

=head2 section

  %= section begin
  ...
  % end

A shortcut for creating a section tag.

  %# longer form
  %= tag section => ...

=head2 markdown_section

  %= markdown_section begin
  ...
  % end

Build a section tag and script/template tag to properly use the built-in markdown handling within this slide.

=head2 revealjs->export

  $ ./myapp.pl eval 'app->revealjs->export("/" => "path/", \%options)'

Exports the rendered page and all of the files in the static directories to the designated path.
This is very crude, but effective for usual cases.

Allowed options are:

=over

=item base

Override the base tag by removing the original and inserting a new one just inside the C<< <head> >> tag with the given value as the href target.
This feature is cludgy (as is this whole helper), consider it experimental, its behavior may change.
